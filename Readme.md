# Walltaker Engine

Like Wallpaper Engine but free, open source, and only for porn.

## Running

- Download and install the latest release from [here](https://github.com/zoomasochist/walltaker-engine/releases) (expand "Assets")
- Open Settings from the system tray and enter your Walltaker ID.
- Thats it!

## Building

The only external dependency is pkg-config. LibVLC is vendored.
